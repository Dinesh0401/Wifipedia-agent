        "question": "Which genus of moth in the world's seventh-largest country contains only one species?",
        "context": "TITLE: Fauna of New Guinea\nSummary: The fauna of New Guinea comprises a large number of species of mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, invertebrates and amphibians.\nAs the world's largest and highest tropical island, New Guinea occupies less than 0.5% of world's land surface, yet supports a high percentage of global biodiversity. Approximately 4,624 vertebrate species inhabit the island of New Guinea and its surrounding waters, which constitutes about 8% of the recognized world vertebrates. This ranges from an estimated 4% of the world's lizards and mammals, to about 10% of the world's fish species.\nThe numbers of global and New Guinea invertebrate species are poorly known, and thus an accurate comparison is difficult. Butterflies are the best known invertebrate group, and are represented in New Guinea by about 735 species, which is about 4.2% of the world total of 17,500 species.\nNevertheless, despite the rich biodiversity, New Guinea's megafauna diversity is quite low since the Pleistocene extinction event, especially when it comes to apex predators. For example, there are only three terrestrial animals at the top of the food chain. Of the three, two are obligate carnivores, the crocodile monitor and the New Guinea singing dog, whilst one, the cassowary, is actually a frugivore but predatory opportunistically and seasonally. In the air, the only endemic apex predator is the New Guinea harpy eagle, whilst in the riverine systems, there are only two, the saltwater crocodile and the smaller New Guinea crocodile.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Asian giant hornet\nSummary: The Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia), also known as the northern giant hornet, and the Japanese giant hornet, is the world's largest hornet.

        "context": "TITLE: Indianapolis Motor Speedway\nSummary: Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a motor racing circuit located in Speedway, Indiana, United States, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400, and formerly the home of the United States Grand Prix and the Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix. It is located six miles (9.7 km) west of Downtown Indianapolis.\nConstructed in 1909, it is the second purpose-built, banked oval racing circuit after Brooklands and the first to be called a 'speedway'. It was the brainchild of entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, who envisioned a proving ground for the budding automobile industry. It is the third-oldest permanent automobile race track in the world, behind Brooklands and the Milwaukee Mile. With a permanent seating capacity of 257,325, it is the highest-capacity sports venue in the world.\nThe track is a 2.500 mi (4.023 km) rectangular oval with dimensions that have remained essentially unchanged since its construction. It has two 0.625 mi (1.006 km) straightaways, four geometrically identical 0.250 mi (0.402 km) turns, connected by two 0.125 mi (0.201 km) short straightaways, termed \"short chutes\", between turns 1 and 2, and between turns 3 and 4. The turns have 9°12' banking, considered relatively flat by American standards.\nA modern, FIA Grade One infield road course was completed in 2000, incorporating part of the oval, including the main stretch and the southwest turn, measuring 2.605 mi (4.192 km). In 2008, and again in 2014, the road course layout was modified to accommodate motorcycle racing, as well as to improve competition. Altogether, the current grounds have expanded from an original 320 acres (1.3 km2) on which the speedway was first built to cover an area of over 559 acres (2.3 km2). Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it is the only such site to be affiliated with automotive racing history.\nIn ad\n\n---\n\nTITLE: 2020 Bathurst 12 Hour\nSummary: The 2020 Liqui-Moly Bathurst 12 Hour was an endurance motor race which was staged at the Mount Panorama Circuit near Bathurst, in New South Wales, Australia on 2 February 2020.
