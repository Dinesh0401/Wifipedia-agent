Lewiston forms one half of the Lewiston\u2013Auburn metropolitan statistical area, commonly referred to as \"L/A\" or \"L-A.\"\nThe city has undergone significant demographic transformation, particularly since the late 20th century. While English remains the predominant language, Lewiston is home to a substantial French-Canadian population. According to some sources, it has the largest French-speaking population in the United States by total number, though second to St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, by percentage of speakers. The city has been recognized for its low cost of living, access to healthcare, and low violent crime rate.\nLewiston was first settled in 1760 and incorporated as Lewistown in 1795.
