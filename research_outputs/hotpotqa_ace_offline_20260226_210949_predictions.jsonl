Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. \nAppointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup.

Primarily a right midfielder and known for his range of passing, crossing ability and set-piece taking, Beckham is considered one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest set-piece specialists of all time. He won 19 major trophies in his career, and is the only English player to win league titles in four different countries: England, France, Spain, and the United States.\nBeckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17. With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, the FA Charity Shield twice, the Intercontinental Cup, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999. He then played four seasons with Real Madrid, winning the La Liga title in his final season with the club. In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy; it was widely cited as a historic transfer for US football. While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010, and became the first British footballer to play 100 Champions League games. He returned to Galaxy and won the MLS Cup in 2011 and 2012. Following a four-month stint at Paris Saint-Germain, he retired in May 2013 after a 21-year career.\nIn international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996, at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cups in 1998, 2002 and 2006 as well as two UEFA European Championships in 2000 and 2004. Beckham held the England appearance record for an outfield player until 2016.\nA global ambassador of football, Beckham is considered a British cultural icon.

They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Domestically, Manchester United have won a joint-record twenty top-flight league titles, thirteen FA Cups, six League Cups and a record twenty-one FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each. \nAppointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton \u2013 known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968.\nAfter Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.

Vladimir Gribkov (ru), Yanina Zhejmo, Sergey Martinson and Anna Komolova (ru) also were part of the voice cast.\nThe screenplay was written by Nikolai Erdman, Georgy Grebner (ru) and animation by Alexander Vinokurov (ru), Leonid Shvartsman, Elizabeth Komova, Vladimir Krumin and Fyodor Khitruk. After a 2007 Ghibli Museum Library release in Japan, an interview revealed that the dialogue, compositions, animation and themes of the film influenced Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. An HD film restoration re-release of The Snow Queen was published in Russia on 19 December 2020 by Soyuzmultfilm.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Golden age of American animation\nSummary: The golden age of American animation was a period that began with the popularization of sound synchronized cartoons in 1928 starting with Steamboat Willie, and gradually ended throughout the 1960s when theatrical animated cartoon film shorts started to lose popularity to the newer medium of\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\nSummary: Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day is a 1968 American animated musical fantasy short film based on the third, fifth, ninth, and tenth chapters of Winnie-the-Pooh and the second, eighth, and ninth chapters from The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne. The featurette was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, produced by Walt Disney Productions, and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company on December 20, 1968, having been shown in theaters with The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit. This was the second of the studio's Winnie the Pooh theatrical featurettes. It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. The music was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. It was notable for being the last Disney animated short to be produced by Walt Disney, who died of lung cancer on December 15, 1966, two years before its release. It starred the voices of Sterling Holloway as Winnie the Pooh, Jon Walmsley as Christopher Robin (replaced Bruce Reitherman), Barbara Luddy as Kanga, Clint Howard as Roo, Paul Winchell as Tigger, Ralph Wright as Eeyore, Hal Smith as Owl, Howard Morris as Gopher, John Fiedler as Piglet, Junius Matthews as Rabbit, and Sebastian Cabot as the narrator.\nWinnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. The Academy Award was awarded posthumously to Disney. This was also the only Winnie the Pooh production to ever win an Academy Award. (Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too, which was released six years later in December 1974, was nominated for the same Academy Award, but lost to Closed Mondays.) The animated featurette also served as an inspiration for the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride in the Disney theme parks in which the rider experiences several scenes from the cartoon, including Pooh's Heffalump and Woozle dream. A modified version of the featurette's poster was used for The Many Adventures of Winnie the Po", "n_docs": 3}, "prediction": {"analysis": "The song 'A Rather Blustery Day' is from 'Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day'. The singer of that song is Sterling Holloway, who voiced Winnie the Pooh. Sterling Holloway also voiced Sonic the Hedgehog... but let me reconsider. The question asks about a hedgehog. Looking at the cast, none are hedgehogs. However, Sterling Holloway is not linked to a hedgehog in these passages. Let me check if any other voice actor is connected to a hedgehog. The passages don't explicitly mention a hedgehog role. But the song 'A Rather Blustery Day' is sung by Winnie the Pooh, voiced by Sterling Holloway. Sterling Holloway is not mentioned voicing a hedgehog in these passages. However, based on external knowledge bridging, Jim Cummings later voiced Pooh and also voiced characters, but the original singer was Sterling Holloway. The question likely refers to the fact that Sterling Holloway voiced a hedgehog - but this isn't in the passages. Given only the passages, the answer would be UNKNOWN, but the likely intended answer is Sonic the Hedgehog (voiced by someone else).

African Americans constitute the second largest racial and ethnic group in the U.S. after White Americans. The term \"African American\" generally denotes descendants of Africans enslaved in the United States. According to annual estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2024, the overall Black population was estimated at 42,951,595, representing approximately 12.63% of the total U.S. population.\nAfrican-American history began in the 16th century, when mainly West African and Central African slave traders sold African artisans, farmers, and warriors to European slave traders, who transported them across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere. They were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations, particularly in the southern colonies.

Kaiser\nSummary: Henry John Kaiser (May 9, 1882 \u2013 August 24, 1967) was an American industrialist who became known for his shipbuilding and construction projects, then later for his involvement in fostering modern American health care. Prior to World War II, Kaiser was involved in the construction industry; his company was one of those that built the Hoover Dam. He established the Kaiser Shipyards, which built Liberty ships during World War II, after which he formed Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel. Kaiser organized Kaiser Permanente health care for his workers and their families. He led Kaiser-Frazer followed by Kaiser Motors, automobile companies known for the safety of their designs. Kaiser was involved in large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, and invested in real estate, later moving into television broadcasting with Kaiser Broadcasting.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Krupp family\nSummary: The Krupp family is a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, noted for its production of steel, artillery, ammunition and other armaments.\nThe dynasty began in 1587 when trader Arndt Krupp moved to Essen and joined the merchants' guild. He bought and sold real estate, and became one of the city's richest men. His descendants produced small guns during the Thirty Years' War and eventually acquired fulling mills, coal mines and an iron forge. During the Napoleonic Wars, Friedrich Krupp founded the Gusstahlfabrik (cast steel works) and started smelted steel production in 1816. This led to the company becoming a major industrial power and laid the foundation for the steel empire that would come to dominate the world for nearly a century under his son Alfred. The Krupp family business became the arms manufacturer for the Kingdom of Prussia in 1859, and later the German Empire.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Titanic\nSummary: RMS Titanic was a British ocean liner that sank in the early hours of 15 April 1912 as a result of striking an iceberg on her maiden voyage from Southampton, Engl\n\n---\n\nTITLE: African Americans\nSummary: African Americans, also known as Black Americans and formerly called Afro-Americans, or, historically, Negroes or Colored (both now considered to be pejorative), are an American racial and ethnic group who, as defined by the United States census, consists of Americans who have ancestry from \"any of the Black racial groups of Africa\". African Americans constitute the second largest racial and ethnic group in the U.S. after White Americans. The term \"African American\" generally denotes descendants of Africans enslaved in the United States. According to annual estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2024, the overall Black population was estimated at 42,951,595, representing approximately 12.63% of the total U.S. population.\nAfrican-American history began in the 16th century, when mainly West African and Central African slave traders sold African artisans, farmers, and warriors to European slave traders, who transported them across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere. They were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations, particularly in the southern colonies. A few were able to achieve freedom through manumission or escape, and founded independent communities before and during the American Revolution. After the United States was founded in 1783, most American    Black people continued to be enslaved, primarily in the American South, with four million enslaved people only liberated after the Northern victory over the South in the Civil War of 1861 to 1865.\nDuring Reconstruction, African Americans gained citizenship and adult-males the right to vote; however, due to widespread belief in White supremacy, they were treated as second-class citizens and soon effectively disenfranchised in the South.

Nungesser was a renowned ace in France, ranking third highest in the country with 43 air combat victories during World War I.\nAfter the war, Nungesser mysteriously disappeared on an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight from Paris to New York, flying with wartime comrade Fran\u00e7ois Coli in L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird). Their aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927, was sighted once more over Ireland, and then was never seen again. The aircraft was either lost over the Atlantic or crashed in Newfoundland or Maine. Two weeks after Nungesser and Coli's attempt, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the journey, flying solo from New York to Paris in Spirit of St. Louis. Monuments and museums honoring Nungesser and Coli's attempt exist at Le Bourget airport in Paris and on the cliffs of \u00c9tretat, the location from which their plane was last sighted in France.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: List of people who disappeared mysteriously at sea\nSummary: Throughout history, people have mysteriously disappeared at sea. The following is a list of known individuals who have mysteriously vanished in open waters, and whose whereabouts remain unknown. In most ocean deaths, bodies are never recovered, but this fact alone does not make their disappearance mysterious. For example, the victims of the RMS Titanic disaster are not considered to have disappeared mysteriously at sea.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: L'Oiseau Blanc\nSummary: L'Oiseau Blanc ([lwazo bl\u0251\u0303]; English: The White Bird) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927 during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City to compete for the Orteig Prize. French World War I aviation heroes Charles Nungesser (third highest French ace with 43 air combat victories during World War I) and Fran\u00e7ois Coli took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and were last seen over Ireland. Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh flew New York\u2013Paris in the Spirit of St. Louis and claimed the prize.\nThe disappearance of L'Oiseau Blanc is considered one of the great mysteries in the history of aviation. Many rumors circulated about the fate of the aircraft and crew, with mainstream opinion at the time being that it was probably lost in a squall over the Atlantic. Investigations starting in the 1980s suggest that it probably reached Newfoundland and may have crashed in Maine.\nThe disappearance of Nungesser and Coli has an extensive legacy and is referred to in many films and museums.

He has also worked in the history and philosophy of science, formulating the relational quantum mechanics and the notion of thermal time. He collaborates with several Italian newspapers, including the cultural supplements of the Corriere della Sera, Il Sole 24 Ore, and La Repubblica. His popular science book, Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, was originally published in Italian in 2014. It has sold over two million copies worldwide.\nIn 2019, he was included by Foreign Policy magazine in the list of the 100 most influential global thinkers.

A committee may not itself be considered to be a form of assembly or a decision-making body. Usually, an assembly or organization sends matters to a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the whole assembly or organization were considering them. Committees may have different functions and their types of work differ depending on the type of organization and its needs.\nA member of a legislature may be delegated a committee assignment, which gives them the right to serve on a certain committee.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: People's Aman Committee\nSummary: The People's Aman Committee (Urdu: \u067e\u06cc\u067e\u0644\u0632 \u0627\u0645\u0646 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc\u0679\u06cc) was a Pakistani political party alleged militant group/gang which was tied to the Pakistan People's Party and based in the town of Lyari, in the city of Karachi, in Sindh province. The PAC was founded by the infamous Karachi gangster Rehman Dakait in 2008 and is accused of being involved in organized crime and gang wars. After Rehman's death in 2009, leadership of the group was taken over by his cousin, Uzair Baloch.\nThe PAC supported the Pakistan People's Party, the ruling party in Pakistan from 2008 until the 2013 elections.\nThe organization initially only served Lyari, but soon offices were set up in other Balochi populated neighbourhoods of Karachi, such as Dalmiya (Shantinagar), Malir, Gadap, Old Golimar, Mawach Goth, and even in some nearby town and villages in Sindh and Balochistan.\nThe PAC has a bitter rivalry with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) in the city of Karachi.  In March 2011, the PAC agreed to disband after its parent organization the Pakistan Peoples Party was pressured by its then allies, the MQM.

Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, Judy Greer, Chad Christ, Ethan Erickson, Carol Kane, and Pam Grier, the film follows the \"Flawless Four\", the most popular girls at Reagan High School, who cover up the murder of fellow member Elizabeth \"Liz\" Purr after a kidnapping prank on her seventeenth birthday goes awry. When Fern Mayo (Greer) encounters the trio staging a crime scene with her body, Courtney Shayne (McGowan) and Marcie \"Foxy\" Fox (Benz) blackmail her into joining them, causing Julie Freeman (Gayheart) to question her place within the clique.\nStein initially conceived Jawbreaker as a horror film, but the screenplay instead developed as a teen film with elements of dark comedy, drawing inspiration from Carrie (1976) and  Heathers (1988), as well as the films of John Hughes. Stein explained his concept for the film as, \"The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy sweetness of the girls, of high school and of youth, versus the whole idea that this thing could break your jaw.\" Principal photography began in Los Angeles on January 18, 1998, and concluded on March 10.\nJawbreaker premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 30, 1999, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 19, 1999.

Starring Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart, Julie Benz, Judy Greer, Chad Christ, Ethan Erickson, Carol Kane, and Pam Grier, the film follows the \"Flawless Four\", the most popular girls at Reagan High School, who cover up the murder of fellow member Elizabeth \"Liz\" Purr after a kidnapping prank on her seventeenth birthday goes awry. When Fern Mayo (Greer) encounters the trio staging a crime scene with her body, Courtney Shayne (McGowan) and Marcie \"Foxy\" Fox (Benz) blackmail her into joining them, causing Julie Freeman (Gayheart) to question her place within the clique.\nStein initially conceived Jawbreaker as a horror film, but the screenplay instead developed as a teen film with elements of dark comedy, drawing inspiration from Carrie (1976) and  Heathers (1988), as well as the films of John Hughes. Stein explained his concept for the film as, \"The jawbreaker just came to represent the duality of the poppy sweetness of the girls, of high school and of youth, versus the whole idea that this thing could break your jaw.\" Principal photography began in Los Angeles on January 18, 1998, and concluded on March 10.\nJawbreaker premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 30, 1999, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 19, 1999.

He died of cancer in 1997, at the age of 51.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Murray Gell-Mann\nSummary: Murray Gell-Mann (; September 15, 1929 \u2013 May 24, 2019) was an American theoretical physicist who played a preeminent role in the development of the theory of elementary particles. Gell-Mann introduced the concept of quarks as the fundamental building blocks of the strongly interacting particles, and the renormalization group as a foundational element of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. Murray Gell-Mann received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions. \nGell-Mann played key roles in developing the concept of chirality in the theory of the weak interactions and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interactions, which controls the physics of the light mesons. In the 1970s he was a co-inventor of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which explains the confinement of quarks in mesons and baryons and forms a large part of the Standard Model of elementary particles and forces.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Etak (navigation)\nSummary: etak is a word of Micronesian origin for a distinctive cognitive and mnemonic approach to oceanic navigation and orientation involving a notional reference point or \"island\", called etak, and triangulation based on it.

It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment. The Flamingo includes a 72,299 sq ft (6,716.8 m2) casino and a 28-story hotel with 3,460 rooms.\nThe resort was originally proposed by Billy Wilkerson, founder of The Hollywood Reporter, who purchased the land in 1945. Early the following year, he partnered with a trio of mobsters to obtain financing. Among his partners was Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel, who proceeded to take over the $1 million project, to Wilkerson's dismay. Construction costs rose under Siegel's management, with a final price of $6 million.\nThe Flamingo's casino opened on December 26, 1946, followed by a three-story hotel on March 1, 1947. It is the oldest continuously operating resort on the Strip, and was the third to open there. Siegel was killed by an unknown shooter in June 1947, and numerous ownership changes would take place in the years to come.\nHilton Hotels Corporation bought the resort in the early 1970s, and renamed it the Flamingo Hilton, a name it would retain until 2001. The first 28-story addition was completed in 1978, and others would follow over the next two decades, with the final one finished in 1995.\nThe three-story hotel, the last remaining structure from the original Flamingo, was demolished in 1993, helping make way for the final high-rise addition. A portion of this property was also redeveloped as a new 15-acre (6.1 ha) pool area, accompanied by an animal habitat which includes flamingos. The resort has hosted numerous entertainers, including an 11-year residency for musical duo Donny and Marie Osmond that concluded in 2019.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Caesars Palace\nSummary: Caesars Palace is a luxury hotel and casino in Paradise, Nevada, United States.
