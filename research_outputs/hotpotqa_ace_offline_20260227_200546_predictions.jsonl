Sweetened liqueurs, wine, or beer may also serve as the base or be added. If beer is one of the ingredients, the drink is called a beer cocktail.\nCocktails often also contain various types of juice, fruit, honey, milk or cream, spices, or other flavorings. Cocktails may vary in their ingredients from bartender to bartender, and from region to region. Two creations may have the same name but taste very different because of differences in how the drinks are prepared.\nThis article is organized by the primary type of alcohol (by volume) contained in the beverage. Cocktails marked with \"IBA\" are designated as IBA official cocktails by the International Bartenders Association, and are some of the most popular cocktails worldwide.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Zurracapote\nSummary: Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangr\u00eda. It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon. The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts. The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangr\u00eda.\nThe drink is normally prepared in large receptacles during local festivals with many local variations in recipe. It was first drunk in Calahorra, where \"Pe\u00f1a Phillips\" developed the recipe through several competitions. It is the typical drink of the La Rioja area and nearby areas such as northern Burgos, Soria, Ribera Navarra, and the Basque Country.

He began as a student at the Petrograd Technological Institute in 1923, became a Professor in 1930, and was given an appointment at the Leningrad Mechanical Engineering Institute in the same year. His contributions include the Gershgorin circle theorem. He designed a device for constructing ellipses, a copy of which can be seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.\nThe spelling of S. A.

It was first published by the Soviet mathematician Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin in 1931.  Gershgorin's name has been transliterated in several different ways, including Ger\u0161gorin, Gerschgorin, Gershgorin, Hershhorn, and Hirschhorn.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: List of Jewish mathematicians\nSummary: This list of Jewish mathematicians includes mathematicians and statisticians who are or were verifiably Jewish or of Jewish descent. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power in Germany, one-third of all mathematics professors in the country were Jewish, while Jews constituted less than one percent of the population.

He also constructed what is now called the Urysohn universal space and his name is also commemorated in the terms Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Urysohn space, Menger\u2013Urysohn dimension and Urysohn integral equation.

Noether was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, Hermann Weyl, and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.

It was serialized in Shueisha's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for 245 issues published from 1983 to 1988 and initially collected in 27 tank\u014dbon volumes under the Jump Comics imprint. Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth after a nuclear war, the story centers on a warrior named Kenshiro, the successor to a deadly martial art known as Hokuto Shinken, which gives him the ability to kill his opponents by striking their vital points, which often results in an exceptionally violent and gory death. Kenshiro dedicates his life to fighting against the various gangs, bandits, and warlords who threaten the lives of the defenseless and innocent, as well as rival martial artists.\nThe manga was adapted into two anime television series produced by Toei Animation, which together aired on Fuji TV and its affiliates from 1984 through 1988, comprising a combined total of 152 episodes. It has since expanded into a media franchise, including several anime films, a live-action film, original video animations (OVAs), video games, and a series of spin-offs centering on other characters from the original story. It has also spawned a number of video games and pachinko machines produced by Sega Sammy. A new anime television series adaptation produced by TMS Entertainment is set to premiere in 2026.\nEnglish adaptations of the manga were published by Viz Communications as a monthly comic book, and later by Gutsoon! Entertainment as a series of colorized graphic novels, although neither translation was completed. Viz Media published the manga in a series of hardcover editions from 2021 to 2025.

Some authors treat Oligoneuron, the flat-topped goldenrods, as a separate genus than Solidago, while others consider it a section: Solidago sect. Ptarmicoidei.\nGoldenrods can be used as a sustainable method to enrich soil with nitrogen. With an increase of nitrogen levels, there can then be an increase of vegetative growth.\nPlants known as goldenrods include:\n\nBigelowia spp., rayless goldenrods, 2 species native to the Southeastern United States\nCuniculotinus gramineus, Panamint rock goldenrod\nEuthamia spp., flat-topped goldenrods or grass-leaved goldenrods, 5 species native to North America\nGundlachia triantha, Trans-Pecos desert goldenrod\nLorandersonia microcephala, small-headed heath goldenrod\nMedranoa palmeri, Texas desert goldenrod\nPetradoria pumila, rock goldenrod\nSolidago spp., goldenrods, around 120 species native to the Americas, northern Africa, Europe, Asia\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Solidago\nSummary: Solidago, commonly called goldenrod, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Goldenrod (showboat)\nSummary: Goldenrod was a floating theater, known as a showboat, which operated on the Mississippi River and its tributaries throughout the 20th Century.  She was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on 24 December 1967 and a St. Louis, Missouri City Landmark in 1972. The boat was placed on the 'Threatened Historical Landmarks' list in 2001.

An early innovator of jazz poetry, Hughes is best known as a leader of the Harlem Renaissance.\nGrowing up in the Midwest, Hughes became a prolific writer at an early age. He moved to New York City as a young man, where he made his career. He studied at Columbia University in New York City. Although he dropped out, he gained notice from New York publishers, first in The Crisis magazine and then from book publishers, subsequently becoming known in the Harlem creative community. His first poetry collection, The Weary Blues, was published in 1926. Hughes eventually graduated from Lincoln University.\nIn addition to poetry, Hughes wrote plays and published short story collections, novels, and several nonfiction works. From 1942 to 1962, as the civil rights movement gained traction, Hughes wrote an in-depth weekly opinion column in a leading black newspaper, The Chicago Defender.\n\n---\n\nTITLE: Mary Sampson Patterson Leary Langston\nSummary: Mary Sampson Patterson Leary Langston (born Mary Sampson Patterson; c. 1835 \u2013 1915) was an American abolitionist, the first African-American woman to attend Oberlin College, and wife of notable abolitionists Lewis Sheridan Leary and Charles Henry Langston.

The prediction that Sigmund Freud had to escape the Nazis is historically accurate, but the provided context does not directly state this. The context only gives biographical information about Freud without mentioning his escape from the Nazis. That said, the prediction is not contradicted by the context, and Freud being Austrian and dying in 1939 is consistent with the claim. However, faithfulness requires the answer to be grounded in the provided context, and the context does not explicitly mention escaping Nazis."}}
